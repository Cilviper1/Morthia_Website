    "description": "The island of Fane is the largest of the Demlin Isles and         steeped in mystery. It is home to the largest mountain in Pyre, known as         the God's Horn, who's peak can be seen all the way from Baldurkeep on a         clear day. However, not much else is known about the island. Attempts to         explore or colonize it have historically ended in disaster, with entire         companies of soldiers disappearing after landing on its shores."

    "leader": "Chief Margol the Cursed",
    "description": "While still technically a colony of the Empire, Trig has         been forgotten due to its location in the far north and enjoys relative         autonomy as a result. The Orcs of Trig live in open opposition to the         Empire, raiding the Plains tribes to the south nearly as much as they clash        with the other Orc colonies. Trig's leaders have been traditionally very extreme        in their separatist beliefs, seeking to take back old lands that         were stolen by the Empire."

It is not considered a         colony under the Empire as it is said to have split from either Fo or Trig sometime         in the past fifty years. Not much is known about the political beliefs of Belfrost         Orcs, however, they have been known to come over the mountains to raid the north.         Their leader, Chief Lo'tan is an old general who fought against the Imperial         Expansion. He is known for his calm head and patience."

Fo        Orcs have no intentions of going to war with the empire again and simply want to be         left to their own business in their new northern home. Occasionally, Orcs from Fo and         Maul clash with militia in Di’Loth, Teth, and Westfall."

    "description": "Maul is an Orcish colony closely allied with the Fo warband. Because         of its location, Maul warriors often come into contact, sometimes violently, with         the humans of the north. While their numbers are small, Maul breeds fearsome warriors.         Children of the north likely know Maul for their shape changing shamans, who play the         villain in countless bedtime stories."

    "leader": "Lord Edwin Colburne",
    "description": "Annis is a small port town isolated at the north eastern tip of the realm.         Far removed from the central powers of the empire, the mostly human population of Annis         doesn't take kindly to outsiders. Annis’s position so far from the capital also makes         them strangers to magic and other arcane arts.

After         starving his people and refusing to pay taxes to the Empire, the Mayor was publicly         assassinated. When the people held an election to determine their new leader, an outsider         named Excessive Warlock emerged as a contender and won the vote. Excessive rules fairly         and is relatively respected by the people, though it is unclear whether he intends to         rebuild ties to the Empire or continue to exist in opposition."

Many brave         explorers have sought to discover what lies beyond, but only one ever returned alive.         Gaviarra of the Aro is said to have returned three years after initially setting out on         her journey. She told of land ruled by God Kings who commanded vast empires, a land that         knew no magic, but harboured strange and dark forces of its own. It is said that Dallion         Ruhss I grew up hearing stories of Gaviarra's travels, and modelled his new Empire after the         ones in the stories."

Unlike most places in Pyre,         Teth is run by a lawman, not politicians or lords. The people of Teth are a tough breed, hardened         by years of conflict with the Mad Mayor as well as Orc raids. The few soldiers allotted to the         Imperial Outpost are not enough to defend the village, so many of the residents have had to learn         to fight to survive or purchase mercenary contracts."

Because of its location, Saltcliff is the only place in the empire         where non-magical flight has been achieved. Hot air balloons are used for trade and warfare.
