City/Settlement,Collective,Anchorage Vista,"Alex Mendoza, 88","Anchorage vista is a medium-sized port town in the Collective- one of only two. Anchorage vista operates as the nearest seaway connector for travel to and from Morheim and the OAR, cutting many days of travel short when compared to the road. But at a high cost. Anchorage Vista enjoys security of invasion from pirates via the Capital Channel, but sits hidden at the northern-most point of the Dreamshard Depths by a handful of islands. Beyond the islands sits a sea riddled with monsters and a “Continent of Death” to the east.",,2875,3519,2905,3549

These areas are newly inhabited by an influx of hags who are coming to see or join the new world, and are in turn beginning to terrorise the space around for their own amusement and benefit. Large parts of the lowlands within the forest are flooded, creating a murky swampland. The lands are covered in collections of trees, and wide-open plains. Wild animals dominate the landscape and legend has it that Giants claim this land for their own; the only area believed to house them. There is rumor of a building army with a new leader, but no one has dared venture near enough to verify these claims.",,,6778,5002,7200,5349

Forest,Morheim,Rage Hollow,"Split and broken by mountains, hills, rivers, and lakes, RageHollow forest is known for its dense and dark atmosphere. It's located south of the Dehum-Smit pathway. One river cut right through the forest from mountains in the north to the Continental River. An eerie fog penetrates the dark of the forest and masks the horrors inside. Howls and growls can be heard at night from nearby towns, spreading fear far and wide. Few would dare brave the brush, and only the insane would dare go in at night. The roof of the forest allows the occasional speck of light into the grounds but never much. The forest is always visible from the clear-cut path heading across the land, and is always on the south. Many locals call it the haunted forest, but there are no spirits here, only monsters. Who can really argue on the distinction though. Any local nearby would urge PC's not to venture off of the path, even to make camp. If anything, stay north.",,,4685,3091,4825,3231
